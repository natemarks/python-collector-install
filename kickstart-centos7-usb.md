# Kickstart driven CentOS 7 install from USB

None of what is written below is particularly original, however, I was unable to find a method documented on the internet at the time of writing that successfully created a kickstart driven CentOS 7 USB installer.

My interest was in doing this _manually_ as I require this USB (image) to be created from a script. Therefore, I did not look into using ISO to USB applications - in addition, these typically do not allow custom kickstart files to be used.

## References
Much of the process described below was found on the [CentOS Wiki](http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/InstallFromUSBkey#line-30) page on Installing from USB key, and from the [Softpanorama](http://www.softpanorama.info/Commercial_linuxes/RHEL/Installation/installation_from_usb_drive.shtml) page on the same subject. I thoroughly recommend reading all of the latter as it highlights the shortcomings/dangers associated with the steps below.

## USB key preparation

### Partition USB
This can probably be done as a disk image too, though I haven't tried this yet. Below I will use /dev/sdX for the USB device.

* Create two partitions, one of type W95 FAT32 (LBA) (assigned code "c" in fdisk) of ~250MB, make this partition bootable. Create an ext3 partition from the remaining space.
```
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
n (create partition, accept defaults for type, number, and first sector)
+250M (defined size as 250MB)
t
c (change type to W95 FAT32 (LBA) - other FAT types may work, but I have not tried)
a (make bootable)
n (create partition, accept defaults for type, number, first sector, and size)
w (write changes to device)
```
* Format partitons
```
sudo mkfs -t vfat -n "BOOT" /dev/sdX1
sudo mkfs -L "DATA" /dev/sdX2
```
* Write MBR data to device
```
sudo dd conv=notrunc bs=440 count=1 if=/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdX
```
* Install syslinux to first parition
```
sudo syslinux /dev/sdX1
```

### Copy files to USB
CRITICAL:  Make sure to copy the same ISO file to the usb that you used to lookmount and copy the usb boot files

* Mount the partitions
```
mkdir BOOT && sudo mount /dev/sdX1 BOOT
mkdir DATA && sudo mount /dev/sdX2 DATA
mkdir DVD && sudo mount /path/to/centos/dvd.iso DVD
```
* Copy DVD isolinux contents to `BOOT`
```
sudo cp DVD/isolinux/* BOOT
```
* rename `isolinux.cfg` to `syslinux.cfg`
```
sudo mv BOOT/isolinux.cfg BOOT/syslinux.cfg
```
* I also deleted a few bits from `BOOT` I didn't think were required, e.g. `isolinux.bin`, `TRANS.TBL`, `upgrade.img`, `grub.conf`.
* I then copied my kickstart file to the `BOOT` directory and the CentOS 7 ISO to the `DATA` partition.

The final file structure looked something like this:
```
BOOT/
├── boot.cat
├── boot.msg
├── initrd.img
├── ks.cfg
├── ldlinux.sys
├── memtest
├── splash.png
├── syslinux.cfg
├── upgrade.img
├── vesamenu.c32
└── vmlinuz
DATA/
└── CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-Minimal.iso
```

### Edit the syslinux.cfg
So that it points to the ISO and the kickstart

Here is the install CentOS 7 entry from the Minimal ISO `isolinux.cfg` (which we renamed `syslinux.cfg`):
```
label linux                                                                     
  menu label ^Install CentOS 7                                                  
  kernel vmlinuz                                                                
  append initrd=initrd.img inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=DATA:/ ks=hd:LABEL=BOOT:/minimal.ks  
```

The `append` line is changed to read the following:
```
append initrd=initrd.img inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=DATA:/ ks=hd:LABEL=BOOT:/minimal.ks
```
I suspect LABEL could be used here, rather than the enumerated device, which would make it safer, but I haven't tried this yet. Assuming the system you are installing on only has a single HD the USB key will be enumerated as sdb more information about this can be found in the [Softpanorama](http://www.softpanorama.info/Commercial_linuxes/RHEL/Installation/installation_from_usb_drive.shtml) article.

When you boot from the USB and select Install CentOS 7, it now installs the system as described by your kickstart.
