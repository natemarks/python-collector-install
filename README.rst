install tools for collectors

* Free software: BSD 2-Clause License

Installation
============

::

    pip install collector-install

Documentation
=============
This project contains the tools for installing collectors. It requries the kickstart files generated by the https://github.com/mcapelli/collector_kickstarts project.  Collector_kickstarts requires data from the https://github.com/mcapelli/python-grains_from_collectors  project.

The general usage of this project is:
- create a custom installation USB
- copy a compressed image of that USB to the target collector
- write the image to the collector's USB drive. NOTE:  the target USB drive has to exactly match the source USB drive
- mount the partition on the USB collector and copy that collector's unique kickstart to minimal.ks
- reboot from the USB and run the installation
- configure and run the salt minion to proceeed with the collector installations



Creating the install USB from scratch
-------------------------------------

We based creation of the bootable install USB on  https://gist.github.com/maikell/58b286a672a82dafe44c0552cd44db04 and modified it to create kickstart-centos7-usb.md. Use the instructions in kickstart-centos7-usb.md and test it before moving on.

One quirk to this process is that after the install, it comes up on the installed disk, but the USB drive shows up as /dev/sda and the hard disk that it's booting from shows up as /dev/sdb. I disabled the USB hard drive from the boot options and the disk drive cam up as sda. That stuck even after I re-enabled the USB drive as a boot optiong

To disable the USB drive on supermicro so to BIOS:
boot -> USB Hard Disk Drive BBS Priorities -> toggle the USB to disabled  and save.

Creating and using the image
----------------------------

First identify the removable device.

::


    [root@PROD01-ZDEL-TEST-001 IMAGE]# cat /sys/block/sda/removable
    0
    [root@PROD01-ZDEL-TEST-001 IMAGE]# cat /sys/block/sdb/removable
    1

In this case, the removable drive is /dev/sdb so we'll create the image and compress it on the fly

::

    dd if=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress | gzip > ./usb_installer.dd.gz

to write the image to /dev/sdb.  Be VERY carefule.  this will destroy the target drive

::

    gunzip -c ./usb_installer.dd.gz | dd of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
